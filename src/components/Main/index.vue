      <h3>Phone Shop</h3>
      <p>
        Cell phone salespeople must meet the sales and customer service goals of a cell phone provider.
        A retail cell phone salesperson must keep tabs on the store's prospective customers, increase traffic
        through activities, and work through family and friends to increase the market awareness of cell phones,
        smartphones, and other wireless technology. By participating in scheduled PR and marketing campaigns,
        salespeople add customers who want to change from another cell phone plan and provider.

        Wireless phone providers also employ business-to-business (B2B) salespeople to offer the company's services
        to businesses of all sizes. Job requirements for B2B cell phone sales include a college degree, five years
        of related work and school experience, customer relations management experience, expertise in growing and
        keeping count of accounts databases, and a knowledge for selling and managing cell phone carrier plans to
        private businesses and government agencies, according to job listings from major wireless providers in October
        2010. Business-to-business cell phone salespeople concentrate on active accounts with the carrier or prospecting
        for new accounts.
